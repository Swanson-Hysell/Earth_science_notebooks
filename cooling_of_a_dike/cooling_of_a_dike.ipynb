    "# Heat transfer during dike cooling\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we are interested in modeling heat transfer during the emplacement and subsequent cooling of dikes. In doing so, we are particularly interested in understanding the timescale for cooling within the dike itself and the magnitude of heating of the host rock into which a dike intruded.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem was dealt with nicely in an article published by Paul T. Delaney of the US Geological Survey:\n",
    "\n",
    "Delaney, P.T. 1987. Heat transfer during emplacement and cooling of mafic dykes In Mafic dyke swarms. Edited by H.C. Halls and W.F. Fahrig. Geological Association of Canada, Special Paper 34, pp. 31-46.\n",

    "## An analytical solution to transient heat conduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Delaney (1987) formulates the problem by idealizing a dike as a tabular channel of infinite extent. Coordinates are based on the position of the dike wall with the $X$-direction being the direction orthogonal to the wall such that negative $X$ values are within the dike and positive $X$ values are in the host rock. The dike has a thickness $T$ and an initial temperature $\\Theta_{mi}$ (subscript stands for magma initial). The host rock has an initial temperature $\\Theta_{hi}$ and a thermal diffusivity $\\kappa_h$.\n",

    "This equation states that the heat conducted into a unit volume minus the heat conducted out is equal to the accumulation of heat within the volume. The right-hand side of equation 1 is the gradient in heat flux, which is given by Fourier's Law, $Q = - k\\partial\\Theta/\\partial X$ where $k$ is thermal conductivity; the left-hand side is the rate of accumulation of heat, where pC is heat capacity per unit volume. If k is constant, then:\n",

    "Thermal diffusivity, $\\kappa = k/(pC)$, measures the ability of a material to conduct heat relative to its ability to accumulate heat.\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Following this introduction, Delaney builds up to presenting the first and simplest whole-time solution. This solution neglects themal property constrasts between the host rock and dike (i.e. $\\kappa_m/\\kappa_h=1$). These thermal property contrasts can affect the maximum temperatures reached in the host rock and early cooling rates, but the influence is rather small. This whole-time solution is:\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Delaney also presents numerical solutions that incorporate the effects of the heat of crystallization, magma flow and the temperature dependance of thermal conductivity and diffusivity. In the application that we are exploring here, the cooling of a breccia dike emplaced within an impact crater, neither the heat of crystallization nor magma flow apply and therefore the analytical solution using transient heat conduction theory will work well for our analysis.
