# Earth science notebooks
This repository contains some Jupyter notebooks that solve Earth science problems.

## cooling_of_a_dike.pynb

This notebook implements a whole-time analytical solution using transient heat conduction theory to determine the time-temperature history of a dike emplaced into relatively cold host rock. It can be viewed here: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/swanson-hysell/Earth_science_notebooks/blob/master/cooling_of_a_dike/cooling_of_a_dike.ipynb

## structural plotting

This folder contains a couple notebooks that use the mplstereonet module (https://github.com/joferkington/mplstereonet) to plot and analyze structural data.
